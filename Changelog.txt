4.55 Changelog

[AMBIENCE] Further improvements and compatibility with GBL Advanced Interaction Module
[CORE] Made MSO compatible with playing as EAST/OPFOR (you need markers named: ammo, ammo_1, respawn_east and respawn_%faction% eg. respawn_RU)
[AMBIENCE] Fixed: Civilians were deleted without proximitycheck - fixes: player got killed, if he took a civilian outside of town in a car. Ensures compatibility with civilian interactions (f.e. AIM: Arresting Civilians)
[CORE] IMPORTANT: Garbage Collector of ACE Jerrycans and tyres (temporary workaround?). Ensures less load overall and decreasing performance over long term sessions.
[ENEMY] DEP Better dispersion of enemy, new style of collecting locations (gives more and better enemy placements), select in params

[ENEMY] IMPORTANT! Made sure TUP_Roadblocks and TUP_AA are not re-compiled everytime they are called (also to ensure better perf. and less red chain/desync)!
