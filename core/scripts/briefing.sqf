"<br/>DESCRIPTION<br/>
===========<br/><br/>
The Multi-Session Operation (MSO) is the ultimate in reality-based gameplay; it is a persistent mission simulating real-life warfare to the best of our capabilities.<br/><br/>
Player status is persistent; upon reconnection, you will respawn with all your gear at the same position you were last time you played.<br/><br/>

<t size=2 align=left>What Now?</t><br/>
Check your tasks and the notes section for after action reports, upcoming missions and recon information.<br/><br/>

Join our teamspeak 3 channel (ts.ausarma.org) to meet up with others on the map, or use the ingame VOIP. If you have skype, send your account name to an MSO Dev member (on BI Forums) and you will be added to the MSO conversation.<br/><br/>
